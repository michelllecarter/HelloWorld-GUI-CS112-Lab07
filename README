GUIs, or Graphical User Interfaces, are the most common way we use computer applications. Whether the input is from the keyboard, mouse, or touch, there are many ways users interact with GUIs to accomplish tasks or solve problems. As a front-end developer, a programmer who focuses on the side that the user interacts with, we must constantly think of our end-users and how to best support them in accomplishing their task. For that, we're going to have to practice some fundamentals of GUI development through learning the JavaFX library.
